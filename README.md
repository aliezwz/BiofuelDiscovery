# BiofuelDiscovery
## 1. Introduction
In BiofuelDiscovery project, we trained three classifier models using Gaussian processes, random forests, and semi-supervised learning algorithms. We then used the SMILES of biofuels classified by these models to train the GAN model. Finally, we added the unique molecules created by the GAN to the total database and repeated the training cycle.
## 2. Tutorial
### 2.1 Prepare the database
To run BiofuelDiscovery project, firstly you need to prepare a dataset containing biofuel molecules and fossil fuel molecules. Here, we call it "training dataset". This dataset should contains columns for "Name", "Smiles" and "Types". The "Name" column contains the name of the molecule. The "Smiles" column contains the **SMILES**(simplified molecular-input line-entry system) of the molecule, **SMILES** is a specification in the form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings[1], you can search for smiles for each molecule on PubChem or use rdkit to generate smiles.  

In addition to the "training database", you still need to prepare a large database containing many biomass molecules. We call it the database.

### 2.2 Installation
The python version we use is 3.8.  
In addition to some commonly used data science libraries, you still need to install some machine learning and chemical information software libraries.   

```
pip install scikit-learn  
pip install torch  
pip install tensorflow  
pip install deepchem  
```  
Additionally, if you want to know all the libraries needed to run Molgan, please check requirements.txt. Also more information you can check the deepchem tutorials.

### 2.3 How to 
In order to run the project, user should follow the following steps:  
1-Select any model in the Classifier fold and train it using trining database. You will get a trianed modle.  
2-Use the trained model to classify your dataset. You will get a database with labels "biofuel" and "non-biofuel".  
3-Save the dataset you used in step 1 and the smiles of the molecules with the label "biofuel" in the newly obtained dataset, and create a new dataset.  
4-Use SMILES dataset to train MolGAN. The MolGAN will generate more unique and vaild smiles.  
5-Merge smiles generated by molgan into "Dataset.csv"  
6-Repeat steps 2-5 and you will get a large number of unique and meaningful biofuel molecules.

# Dataset
In Dataset fold, we have four datasets, "Dataset.csv" is used for three Classifiers, â€œSmiles list.csv" is used for Molgan to generate SMILES, "SemiSupervised_Dataset.csv" is used for Semi-Supervised Learning model, but it have some problem. In addition, we also have a file called "Rd_SMILES".csv, which is used to expand the database.
# Classifier
In Classifier fold, we have three models, these classifiers are used to distinguish biofuels from fossil fuels in the "Dataset.csv".
# Gan
In Gan fold, we use molgan to generated unique vaild molecules.
The molgan code comes from the deepchem tutorial (https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem/blob/master/examples/tutorials/Generating_molecules_with_MolGAN.ipynb)
# RDkit
In this fold, we have two tools, "SMILES TO Random SMILES.py" can convert SMILES to Random SMILES, "Descriptor.py" can calculate all properties of a molecule based on the SMILES.
# PairPlot
We use PairPlot to visualize the relationships between important descriptors for data exploration.
# Others
If you want to run Molgan, please check whether your third-party library version is consistent with that in requirement.txt.
